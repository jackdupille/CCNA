MPLS - Multi Protocol Label Switching

- WAN connectivity can be provided over an MPLS infrastructure, usually operated by the ISP
- Traffic from multiple customers can travel over the providers shared MPLS network, therefrore this is a VPN service
- Different SLAs for uptime and traffic delay and loss are often available at different price points
- Ehternet connections are typically used to the CPE
- MPLS VPNs provided a full mesh topology by default

- A typical VPN will likely traverse many different ISPs, so an SLA is not possible
- When using an MPLS VPN, one ISP owns the entire network, SLAs are available


# Layer 3 MPLS VPN

- MPLS runs across the ISPs core on the Provider Edge (PE) and Provider core (P) routers
- The Customer Edge (CE) does not run MPLS
- The CE routers peer at layer 3 with the PE routers
- Static routes or a routing protocol are used between the CE and PE routers
- The PE router looks like another customer router to the customer
- The providers P routers are transparent to the customer
- The customers sites are in differnet subnets


# Layer 2 MPLS VPN

- The CE router does not peer with the PE router. The entire ISP network is transparent to the customer
- The ISP network acts like a giant switch
- The customer sites are int the same subnet

# Layer 2 MPLS VPN Terminology

- VPLS (Virtual Private LAN Service): Multipoint Layer 2 VPN
- VPWS (Virtual PseudoWire Service): Point-to-Point Layer 2 VPN
