VPNs - Virtual Private Networks

- Provides a private tunnel across a shared public network, like the Internet
- Traffic travelling over the tunnel is encrypted and only readable by authorised users on either end
- Users can share data over the VPN as if they were connected via a physical private link
- VPNs allow an organisation to use the same physical links for connectivity to the internet and between offices
- Because they use shared infrastructure, they are often less expensive that dedicated physical links

### VPN Types

# Site-to-Site VPN

- Terminate on a router or firewall in each office
- Software does not need to be installed on users desktops
- IPSec is typically used for encryption

# Remote Access VPN

- Between a router or firewall in the office and VPN software on an individual users device, CiscoAnyConnect is an example of a Remote Access VPN software that is 
  installed on a users device
- The user can access the VPN from anywhere with an internet connection and has access to their work documents
- Usually use SSL for encryption, but IPSec can also be used

### Configuration Options

# Site-to-Site VPNs

- IPSec Tunnel: Open standard, does not support multicast, therefore if two locations have many routers and subnets and are using a routing protocol such as OSPF,
                we cant advertise those networks over the VPN to the other side because routing protocols use multicast
                
- GRE (Generic Routing ENcapsulation) over IPsec: Adds support for multicast

- IPSec VTI (Virtual Tunnel Interface): Cisco proprietary, simplified configuration, supports multicast

- DMVPN (Dynaic Multipoint VPN): Cisco proprietary, scalable and simple hub and spoke syle configuration but enables direct full mesh connectivity between all
                                 offices
                                 
- FlexVPN: Cisco proprietary, similar to DMVPN, but a newer technoolgy

- GETVPN (Group Encrypted Transport VPN): Cisco proprietary, scalable centralisedd policy for VPN over non-public infrastructure such as MPLS
