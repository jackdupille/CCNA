Queuing

- Used to manage congestion on routers and switches

# Congestion Management

- CBWFQ (Class Based Weighted Fair Queuing) - gives bandwidth guarantees to specific traffic types
- LLQ (Low Latency Queuing) - Is CBWFQ with a priority queue
  - Traffic in the priority queue is sent first

- QoS Queuing is configured using the MQC (Modular QoS CLI)

# MQC (Modular QoS CLI)

- 3 main sections
  1. Class Maps - Define the traffic to take action on
  2. Policy Maps - Takes the action on that traffic
  3. Service Policies - APplies the Policy to an interface
