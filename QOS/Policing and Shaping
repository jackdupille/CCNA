Policing and Shaping

- Used to control traffic rates
- They both measure the rate of traffic through an interface and take action if the rate is above a configured limit
- Shaping buffers any excess traffic so the overall traffic stays within the desired rate limit
- Policing drops or remarks excess traffic to enforce the specified rate limit
- Classification can be used to allow different rate for different traffic types
