Usernames and Privilege Levels

- We can take security to a higher level than line level, by configuring individual usernames and passwords
- This also provides a level of responsibility as you can find out which users have been logged in

      router#conf t
      router(config)#username <USERNAME> secret <PASSWORD>
      router(config)#username <USERNAME2> secret <PASSWORD>
      router(config)#line console 0
      router(config-line)#login local     <- This ensures usernames and passwords are used at the console level
      router(config-line)#line vty 0 15
      router(config-line)#login local     <- This ensures usernames and passwords are used over VTY connections
      
      
# Privilege Levels

- There are 16 levels, 0-15
- We can assign privilege levels to individual users
- Default is level 1
- Commands can also be configured with a particular privilege level
- All this means that it is possible to configure a user a certain level of access, and restrict them to only a certain range of commands
- By default, 3 of the 16 levels are used, they are:
   1. Zero
   2. User Exec (Level 1)
   3. Privilege Exec (Level 15)

# Configuraing username level security

      router#en
      router(config)#username <USERNAME> privilege <NUMBER> secret <PASSWORD>
      router(config)#line console 0
      router(config-line)#login local
      router(config-line)#line vty 0 15
      router(config-line)#login local
      
- If a user has no privilege level, they will dfault to level 1 when they login and will be greeted by the User Mode prompt (>)
- If a user has a privilege level configured, such as 15, as soon as the login they will e escalated to User Exec mode (#)

# Configure a command to a certain Privilege Level

      router#en
      router(config)#username jack privilege 5 secret jackiscool
      router(config)#privilege exec level 5 show running-config
      
- Now the level 5 user "jack" is able to run the "show run" command, which was previously a level 15 command
