AAA - Authentication, Authorisation and Accounting

- Line security has a scalability issue as all devices need configuring manually
- AAA servers centralise this process
- Multiple AAA servers can be used for redundancy
  - Authentication: Verifies someone is who they claim to be. Achieved with a username and password
  - Authorisation: Specifies what a particular user is allowed to do.
  - Accounting: Keeps track of individual users actions
- Authorisation and Accounting are optional, Authentication is required either of the other two are used

# AAA Protocols

- RADIUS and TACACS+ are the protocols used by AAA servers
- Both are open standards
- RADIUS is commonly used for end user level services such as VPN access
- TACACS+ is commobly used for administrator access on Cisco devices, and has more ranular authorisation capabilities

# How AAA servers work

- An admin will SSH on to a router, the router will challenge the SSH session by asking for a username and password
- The admin enters their username and password
- If local authentication was being used, then the router would perform the verification itself at this point
- However the admins username and password are stored externally on the AAA server
- The router uses RADIUS or TACACS+ (preferrably TACACS+ for this usage) to send the entered username and password to the AAA server
- The AAA server will check if the username and password are valid or not and notify the router
- The AAA server may also send optional Authentication information about the user back to the router, such as their privilege level and what commands they can use

# AD Integration

- We can move the user database form the AAA server to the AD Domain Controller
- Whwn the router sends the entered username and password to the AAA server, the AAA server use LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocl) to send the username
  and password to the AD Domain Controller
- The AD Domain Controller will then tell the AAA server if the username and password are valid or not
- THe AAA server then notifies the router and sends any optiona Authorisation information
