VTP - VLAN Trunking Protocol

- Allows you to add, edit or delete VLANs on switches that are configured as VTP Servers
- Other switches can then be configured as VTP clients and then synchronise their VLAN Databases with the VTP Servers
- Convenient for large campuses
- Port level VLAN configuration is still required on the VTP Client switches

### VTP Modes

VTP Server

- Can add, edit or delete VLANs
- Will synchronise its VLAN Database from another VTP Server with a higher revision number
- This can cause issues if the new VFP Server does not have the required VLANs configured, resulting in VLANs being deleted

VTP Client

- Cannot add, edit or delete VLANs
- Will synchronise its VLAN Database from a VTP Server with the highest revision number

VTP Transparent

- Does not participate in the VTP Domain
- Does not advertise or learn VLAN information, but will pass it on
- Can add, edit or delete VLANs in its own local VLAN Database
- Any VLANs that are configured on the VTP Server need to e manually configured on here also
