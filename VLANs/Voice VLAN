VLANs - Voice VLAN

- The Voice VLAN is used to seperate Voice traffic from an IP phone and data traffic from an end host
- The end host connects to the IP phone and the IP phone connects to the switch
- The end host is not directly connected to the switch
- However the link between the IP phone and the switch carries traffic for two VLANs, therefore the switch interface acts like a Trunk port, but we do not
  configure it as one
  
  switch ---------- IP Phone ----------- PC
  
- The link between the PC and the IP Pone carries Data traffic, lets say for vlan 10
- The link between the IP Phone and the switch carries Data traffic for vlan 10 and also Voice traffic for lets say vlan 100
