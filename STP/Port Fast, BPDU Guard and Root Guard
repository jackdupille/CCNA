Port Fast, BPDU Guard and Root Guard

- It can take up to 50 seconds for traditional STP to transition a port from Blocking to Forwarding
- It is not possible for a loop to be formed when a switch is connected to a single end host, suchh as a PC or server
- You can make the port become a forwarding port immediately by disabling STP on the interface

switch1#conf t
switch1(config)#interface fa0/1
switch1(config-if)#spanning-tree portfast

- We can make Port Fast the default on the switch for all interface

switch1(config)#spanning-tree portfast default

- Then remember to disable portfast on any interfaces connected to another switch

switch1(config)#interface fa0/2
switch1(config-if)#no spanning-tree portfast default

- However Port Fast can be dangerous, if a user removes the PC or server connected to the Port Fast enabled switch port and instead plugs in another switch which
  they connect to switch1 and switch2, a loop will be formed creating a broadcast storm
- This is where BPDU Guard comes in
- We can enable BPDU Guard on all Port Fast enabled interfaces, then if the interface receives a BPDU (which only switches send out), the receiving switch will
  shutdown the interface

switch1(config)#interface fa0/1
switch1(config-if)#spanning-tree portfast
switch1(config-if)#spanning-tree bpduguard enable

- Again we can enable it across all interfaces on the switch when enabling Port Fast globally

switch1(config)#spanning-tree portfast bpduguard enable default



### Root Guard

- Prevents an unintended switch from becoming the Root Bridge
- If an old switch gets plugged in to the network and it happens to have a higher priority set on it from an old configuration, it will take over the role of
  Root Bridge
- We can prevent this by enabling Root Guard on the interfaces connecting to the new switch
- Root Guard will then place the interfaces in to a state of root-inconsistent

switch1(config)#interface fa0/3
switch1(config-if)#spanning-tree guard root
