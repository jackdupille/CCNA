STP Verification

NOTE - Cisco switches use PVST+ by default
	 - Cisco identifies PVST+ as ieee

switch#show spanning-tree vlan<id>

- Identifies the if the switch is the Root Bridge for the specified VLAN
- Provides two main section; the Root ID section and Bridge ID section
	- Root ID: Provides information about the Root Bridge within the STP instance
		- Cost to reach the Root Bridge
		- The Root port interface name
	- Bridge ID: Provides information about the physical switch you are looking at
- The last section gives information aboue the interfaces that are connected to other switches
	- Interface name
	- Port state
	- Port Role
	- Path cost
	etc


switch#show mac address-table

- This is useful for mapping out the path traffic is taking
- If we want to confirm the path traffic from a certain PC is taking to reach the a certain destination router, we can check the routers LAN facing interface
  then check the MAC address table on the switches we expect the traffic to traverse to ensure they have entries for the routers interface, and which interface
  it is sending traffic out of
