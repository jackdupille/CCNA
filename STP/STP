STP - Spanning Tree Protocol

- Used to prevent Layer 2 Loops between switces
- Unlilke the Layer 3 IP Header, the Layer 2 Ethernet Header DOES NOT have a TTL (Time To Live) Field to prevent loops
- These Layer 2 Loops are caused by Broadacast traffic such as ARP Requests and DHCP Discover messages
- These loops are commonly referred to as Broadcast Storms and are devastating to networks
- STP prevents Broadcast Storms by detecting potential loops in the network and placing relevant switch ports in to a Blocking state
- STP performs automatic failover, and transitions an interface from Blocking to Forwarding
- Legacy STP Convergence can take up to 50 seconds

### How STP Works

- Enabled by default on all vendor switches
- When a switch comes online it sends out BPDUs (Bridge Protocol Data Units) out all ports. These are used to detect other switches and potential loops
- The switch will not forward traffic out any poprt until it is certain it is loop free
- All ports start in a Blocking state, if no loop then the port transitions to a Forwarding state, process can take up to 50 seconds

The Bridge ID

- The BPDU contains the switches Bridge ID, which uniquely identifies it on the LAN
- The Bridge ID contains the interfaces unique MAC address and an Admin definied Bridge Priority, 0 - 65535, 32768 is the default value

The Root Bridge

- A Root Bridge is elected based on the Bridge ID values
- The switch with the lowest Priority vlaue is elected the Root Bridge
- In the event of a Priority value tie, the switch with the lowest MAC address is elected the Root Bridge
- Other switches will then detect their lowest cost path to the Root Bridge, these links will then be placed in a Forwarding state

Root Ports

- Each switches exit interface on the lowest cost path to the Root Bridge is elected as the Root Port

Load Balancing

- STP does NOT perform load balancing
- If a switch has an equal cost path to the Root Bridge via two switches, it will select the path connected to the neighbor switch with the lowest Bridge ID
- That interface will be placed in a Forwarding state whilsst the other link will e placed in a Blocking state
- If a switch has multiple equal cost paths to the SAME switch, again it will not load balance and will place its port that has the lowest port ID in a
  Forwarding state, its other ports will be in a Blocking state
  
Designated Ports

- Ports on the neighbor switch opposite a Root Port are called Designated Ports
- Root Ports point towards the Root Bridge, Designated Ports point away from the Root Bridge
- Due to this nature, all ports on the Root Bridge are Designated Ports by default
- Root Ports and Designated Ports are the most direct paths to the Root Bridge and always transition to a Forwarding state

Other Links

- On the remaining links between two switches, we need to determine which side of the link will be placed in a Blocking state
- The switches determine which of them has the least cost path to the Root Bridge, if the paths are equal cost, then the lowest Bridge ID wins
- The interface on the winning switch is elected as the Designated port on that link, and the interface on the other switch is placed in a Blocking state

Blocking Ports

- STP only blocks ports on one side of the link
- The blocked port still accepts and sends BPDUs, but all other traffic is dropped

How to determine the Port States

1. Determine the Root Bridge first (lowest Bridge ID)
2. All ports on the Root Bridge are Designated Ports
3. Determine the Root Ports on the other switches (lowest cost to the Root Bridge)
4. Ports opposite the Root Ports are Designated Ports
5. On the remaining links, one port will be Blocking
6. Determine the Blocking Port (highest cost path to the Root Bridge, or highest Bridge ID)
7. Ports opposite the Blocking Port is a Designated Port
