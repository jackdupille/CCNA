STP Troubleshooting

### Scenario

The Network Operations Centre has reported that traffic is not following the most direct path from the branch office PCs to the Internet. Your task at this stage
is to verify this.

Step 1: If HSRP is configured, check which router is Active and which is Standby

	router#show standby
	
Step 2: Check the PCs have connectivity to the destination IP

	PC>ping <destination IP>
	
Step 3: Check the Layer 3 path the PCs are taking to reach the destination IP, if both going via the Active router, then the HSRP configuration is working

	PC>tracert <destination IP>
	
Step 4: Check which VLANs the PCs are in on the Access Layer switches

	switch#show vlan brief
	
Step 5: Check the interfaces on the Dist/Core Layer switches connecting to the routers have also been configured as Access ports in the same VLAN as the PCs

	Dist/CoreSW#show run
	
Step 6: On all switches, check the interfaces connecting to other switches have been configured as Trunk ports

	switch#show run
	
Step 7: If everything up to now is OK, then HSRP and VLAN configuration is good

Step 8: Check STP Configuration, one of the Dist/Core Layer switches should be the Root Bridge, if an Access Layer switch is the Root Bridge, that is a problem

	Dist/CoreSW#show spanning-tree vlan <ID>
	
Step 9: Identify how the Root Bridge has been elected, has Priority been manipulated or is the lowest MAC address the result? Check on all switches

	switch#show run | include priority
	
Step 10: Check all switches agree on the Root Bridge by checking the Root Bridge MAC address

	switch#show spanning-tree vlan <ID>
	
Step 11: Start diagraming the topology, we now know the Root Bridge
		 Add all the port roles, DP, RP, ALT (BLK)
		 
Step 12: Remove any blocking links to simplify the topology and show the spanning tree itself

Step 13: Document the paths each PC will take

Step 14: Verify the paths
		 Get the Virtual MAC address for HSRP
		 
		 	R1# show standby
			
		 Clear ARP cache on the PCs and ping the HSRP Virtual IP
		 View the MAC address table on each Access Layer switch and determine which interface traffic is forwarded out to reach the HSRP Virtual MAC address
		 
		 	switch#show mac address-table
			
		 View the MAC address table on all hop switches to map out the path
