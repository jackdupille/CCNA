Syslog

- There is a set standard format to a Syslog message
- The format is ass follows:

        seq no : time stamp : %facility-severity-MNEMONIC : description
        
- Example:

      *Oct 3 00:44:12.627: %LINK-5-CHANGED: Interface FastEthernet0/0, chaned state to administratively down
      
- seq no: Optional
- time stamp: Month Day time
- facility: %LINK
    - Indicates something with a link has changed, could just as likely be %OSPF if something with OSPF changed etc
- severity: 5
    - 8 severity levels, 0-7. 0 is the most severe
- MNEMONIC: CHANGED
    - Very brief "description"
- description: Interface FastEthernet0/0, chaned state to administratively down

# Logging Locations

  - Console Line: Enabled by default, at level 0 and up
  - VTY Line: Not enabled by default
  - The logging Bugger: Events saved in RAM, can be viewd with the "show logging" command, enabled by default
  - Remote Syslog server: 
  
# Logging Configurations

  # Console (enabled by default)
  
      router(config)#no logging console   <- disable console logging
  
  # VTY
  
      router(config)#logging monitor 6    <- Monitoring messages from 0-6
      
  # Logging Buffer
  
      router(config)#logging buffered debugging   <- Log everything,0-7
      
  # External Syslog server
  
      router(config)#logging <SERVER IP>
      router(config)# logging trap debugging
      
# Verification

    router#show logging
    
# Logging Synchronous

- When a syslog message is displayed, it will be displaye in the middle of your command, to prevent this use the following command

    router(config)#line console 0
    router(config-line)#logging synchronous
    router(config-line)#line vty 0 15
    router(config-line)#logging synchronous
    
- This wont stop the message from coming up, but will return you to the prompt and reprint your command from where it was interrupted

# Terminal Monitor

- Enable debug messages over VTY

    router#terminal monitor
