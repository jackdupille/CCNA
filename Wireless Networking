Wireless Networking

- WiFi services are defined in the IEEE 802.11 standards

# Network Types

  - WPAN: Wireless Personal Area Network
    - Devices are with 10 metres of each other, bluetooth is often used
  
  - WLAN: Wireless Local Area Network
    - Provides access to a campus (typically wired), without the need for a cable
    - Devices are within 100 metres of an AP (Access Point)
    
  - WMAN: Wireless Metropolitan Area Network
    - Covers a large area such as a city
    
# Ad Hoc Mode

  - Devices connect to and communiate with each other directly, no AP is involved. Peer-to-peer network
  - The area of connected devices is known as an IBSS (Independant Basic Service Set)
  - Scalbility issue
    
# Infrastructure Mode

  - Wireless stations (laptops, phones etc) communicate via a Wireless Access Point (AP)

- Devices can use both Ad Hoc or Infrastructure Mode, but not at the same time

# WiFi Direct

  - Allows devices to be connected to an AP and also be part of a peer-to-peer wireless network
  - Does not operate in Ad Hoc IBSS mode, it is an extension to Infrastructure Mode
  - WPS WiFi Protected Setup enables communication setup at the press of a button
  - Technically a WPAN
