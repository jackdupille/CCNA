IPv6 and Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP)

- The IPv6 Header is simpler than the IPv4 Header
- The IPv4 Header has a variable length, 20-60 Bytes
- The IPv6 Headaer has a fixed length of 40 Bytes

### Fields

1. Version:
  - 4 bits in length
  - Indicates the version of IP used, fixed value of 0b0110 (6)
 
2. Traffic Class:
  - 8 bits in length
  - Like the DSCP field in IPv4, it is used for QoS

3. Flow Label:
  - 20 bits in length
  - Used to identify specific traffic flow between a source and destination
  
4. Payload Length:
  - 16 bits in length
  - Used to identify the size of the encapsulated Layer 4 segment in bytes
  - The IPv6 header is not included as it has a fixed size of 40 bytes
  
5. Next Header:
  - 8 bits in length
  - Indicates the type of the next header, TCP or UDP for example
  - Same function as the Protocol field in the IPv4 header
  
6. Hop Limit:
  - 8 bits
  - Value is decremented by 1 by each router that forwards it, if the value reaches 0 the packet is dropped
  - Same function as the IPv4 TTL field
  
7. Source:
  - 128 bits in length
  - Containis the sending devices IPv6 address
  
8. Destination:
  - 128 bits in length
  - Contains the receiving devices IPv6 address
  
  
### Solicited Node Multicast Addresses

- These are a special multicast address that is formed by combining FF02::1:FF and the last 6 hexadecimal digits of the interfaces global unicast address
- For example an interface with the global unicast address of 2001:db8:ef8:22ff:fe36:8500 would have a Solicited Node address of:

  ff02::1:ff36:8500

### Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP)

- IPv6 version of ARP
- NDPs ARP Like function uses ICMPv6 and Solicited Multicast addresses to learn the MAC addresses of other hosts
- There are two message types:
  1. Neighbor Solicitation (NS) = ICMPv6 Type 135 - This is the equivilant of an ARP Request
  2. Neighbor Advertisemant (NA) = ICMPv6 Type 136 - This is the equivilant of an ARP Reply
  
- In order to learn a hosts MAC address, the sending device will send a Neighbor Solicitation (NS) address to the neighbors Solicited Multicast Address
- Unlike ARP which sends a broadcast ARP Request message, the Neigbor Solicitation message only goes to the individual destination host
- The destination host then simply relpies with a Neighbor Advertisemant (NA) message detailing its MAC address

- NDP also allows host to automatically discover routers on the network
- There are two messages for this process:
  1. Router Solicitation (RS) - ICMPv6 Type 133
    - Sent to multicast address ff02::2 (All Routers)
    - Asks all routers on the local network to identify themselves
    - Sent when an interface is enabled or when a host is connected to the network
    
  2. Router Advertisemant (RA) - ICMPv6 Type 134
    - Sent to multicast address ff02::1 (All Nodes)
    - The router announces its presence as well as other inforamtion about the network
    - These messages are sent in response to an RS message
    - They are also sent periodically, even if the router has not received an RS message
