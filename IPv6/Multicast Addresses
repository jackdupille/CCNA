Multicast Addresses

- IPv6 does not use Broadcast addresses, instead Multicast is used
- IPv6 uses the range FF00:/8 for Multicast

### Common Multicast Addresses

                                          IPv6           IPv4
All nodes/hosts (like a broadcast)      FF02::1        224.0.0.1
All Routers                             FF02::2        224.0.0.1
All OSPF Routers                        FF02::5        224.0.0.5
All OSPF DRs/BDRs                       FF02::6        224.0.0.6
All RIP Routers                         FF02::9        224.0.0.9
All EIGRP Routers                       FF02::A        224.0.0.10

### Multicast scopes

- Multicast scopes define how far a packet should be forwarded

- Interface-Local (FF01): The packet does not leave the local device, can be used to send traffic to a service within the local device
- Link-Local (FF02): The packet remains in the local subnet. Routers will not forward the packet between subnets
- Site-Local (FF05): The packet can be forwarded by routers, but should be limited to a single physical location, not over a WAN
- Organisation-Local (FF08): Wider in scope than Site-Local
- Global (FF0E): No boundaries, possible to be routed over the internet
