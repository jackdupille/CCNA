Global Unicast Addresses

- There are 3 different IPv6 Address Types
  1. Global Unicast
  2. Unique Local
  3. Link Local
  
- Global Unicast addresses are similar to Public IPv4 addresses
- They are assigned to an individual host and have global reachability, unless blocked by a security device such as a Firewall
- They are assigned form the range 2000::/3
- Internet authorities assign blocks from the overall range of 2000::/3 to organisations
- A common assignment is a /48, such as 2001:10:10::/48
- IPv6 standards suggest that an address assigned to an individual host should get a /64 mask
- the IPv6 address is 128-bits long, so this cut the address up to half for the network portion and half for the host portion

- If a company is assigned a /48 block and uses /64 addresses for the internal hosts. 64-48 = 16 bits left to assign to subnets
- E.g. Acompany is assigned 2001:10:10::/48, it can assign subnets 2001:10:10:0::/64 - 2001:10:10:FFFF::/64 to its internal network segments
- 16 bits = 65,535 possible subnets
- 64 bits left over = 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 hosts per subnet...

# Configuration

    router#conf t
    router(config)#ipv6 unicast-routing   <- Enable IPv6 first
    router(config)#interface fa0/0
    router(config-if)#ipv6 address 2001:db8:0:1::1/64
    router(config-if)#interface fa0/1
    router(config-if)#ipv6 address 2001:db8:0:0::1/64
    
### Broadcast and Multicast

- IPv6 supports broadcast to all hosts on 255.255.255.255
- Routers do not forward broadcast traffic so the traffic stays on the local subnet
- IPv6 does not support broadcast traffic
- It does however support multicast to all hosts on the local subnet (FF02::1), which is functionally the same
- Many services that use IPv4 broadcast traffic, use more specific multicast addresses in IPv6, such as FF05::1:3 forDHCP Discover messages
