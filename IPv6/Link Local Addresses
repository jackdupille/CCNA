Link Local Addresses

- Valid for communications on that link only
- Assigned from the range FE80::/10 -  FEB0::/10
- Hosts should be assigned /64 addresses


          FE80::1/64                                FE80::2/64    FE80::4/64          FE80::5/64
        R1 ---------------------- SW1 ------------------------- R2 -------------------------- R4
                                   |
                                   |
                                   |
                                   |
                                   |  FE80::3/64
                                   R3
                                   
- In the above topology, R1, R2 and R3 have connectivity to each other via FE80::1/64, FE80::2/64 and FE80::3/64 and are on the same network segment attached to a
  switch
- R2 and R4 have connectivity via FE80::4/64 and FE80::5/64
- Neither FE80::1/64, FE80::2/64 or FE80::3/64 have connectivity to FE80::4/64 or FE80::5/64 because they are on a differnet network segment

- These addresses can be used for communications that should not be forwarded beyond the local link, such as OSPF Hello packets etc
- They are mandatory on Cisco IPv6 enabled router interfaces

- They are automatically generated by the EUI-64 address method when IPv6 is enabled on the interface, but the address can be overwritten with manual configuration

### Manual Configuration

    router#en
    router(config)#ipv6 unicast-routing
    router(config)#interface fa0/0
    router(config-if)#ipv6 address fe80::1 link-local   <- No need for the subnet mask, default is /64
    router(config-if)#interface fa0/1
    router(config-if)#ipv6 address fe80::1 link-local
    
- Notice that as long as the interfaces are on different network segments, we can configure the same link local address without a conflict occuring

### Multiple Addresses

- With IPv4 we can have two IPs on an interface max, this is simply configured by adding the keyword "secondary" during the standard IP configuration
- However, we can have multiple IPv6 addresses on a single interface
- We can also configure the router to be a dual stack router meaning the interface can have both IPv4 and IPv6 interfaces and the router can route both
