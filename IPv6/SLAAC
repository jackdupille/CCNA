SLAAC - Stateless Address AutoConfiguration

- Hosts can be assigned addresses through static addressing such as DHCPv6 or SLAAC
- DHCP servers track their MAC address to IP address assignments, this is "stateful" addressing
- With SLAAC, hosts learn the /64 subnet their interface is on from their local router, and then use this information to generate their own EUI-64 address
- The router does not track which host has which IP address, so this is "stateless" addressing
- When a global unicast address is configured on an interface, Router Advertisements advertising the network prefix are sent out by default
- These ICMP messages are sent to the "All Nodes" multicast address from the interfaces link-local address
- Hosts can also send "Router Solicitation" messages to request the information

- As well as telling the hosts which subnet to use to generate the IP address on, the Router also tells the hosts to use its self as their default gateway
- Hosts cannot get their DNS server information from SLAAC, so a DHCP/DNS server is still required

### The Unspecified Address

- :: is the "unspecified" address or "unknown" address
- An IPv6 route to ::/0 is a default route equivilant to 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 in IPv4
- :: is also used as the source address when a host is trying to acquire an address via DHCPv6

### Neighbor Discovery

- IPv6 version of ARP
- Very similar to ARP, but uses ICMP Neighbor Solicitations and Neighbor Advertisements instead of ARP Requests and Replies
- Neighbor Solicitations are sent to the Solicited-Node multicast address, which reaches all hosts on the subnet
