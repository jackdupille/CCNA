SLAAC - Stateless Address AUto-Configuration

- Hosts use the Router Solicitation (RS) and Router Advertisemant (RA) messages to learn the subnet prefix from the router, such as 2001:db8::/64, they can   then automatically generate an IPv6 address
- You can then use the "ipv6 address autoconfig" command, the device will then use NDP to learn the IPv6 prefix used on the subnet
- The device will then use EUI-64 addressing to generate an IPv6 address
- Think of this as EUI-64 but automatically configured instead of manually
