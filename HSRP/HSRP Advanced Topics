HSRP Advanced Topics

### Priority and Pre-emption

- This enables us to choose which router is Active and which is Standby
- By default the router with the higher IP is Active
- We can set the priority to change this behaviour, the router with the higher priority will become Active
- If we enable Pre-emption, when a router with a higher priority comes back online after a failure, it will transition back to being Active

### Configuration

Router 1:

router1>en
router1#conf t
router1(config)#interface fa0/1
router1(config-if)#ip address 10.10.10.2 255.255.255.0
router1(config-if)#standby 1 ip 10.10.10.1
router1(config-if)#standby 1 priority 110
router1(config-if)#standby 1 preempt

Router 2:

router2>en
router2#conf t
router2(config)#interface fa0/1
router2(config-if)#ip address 10.10.10.3 255.255.255.0
router2(config-if)#standby 1 ip 10.10.10.1
router2(config-if)#standby 1 priority 90
router2(config-if)#standby 1 preempt

- The above configuration will make Router 1 the Active router because it has a higher Priority value
- Should Router 1 fail and Router 2 become Active, once Router 1 is back online it will once again become the Active Router as it is configured with Pre-emption


### "Active/Active HSRP"

- We can configure our network so that one vlan sends traffic to ROuter 1 and another vlan sends traffic to Router 2
