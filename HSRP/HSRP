HSRP - Hot Standby Routing Protocol

- Popular redundancy protocol within Cisco networks
- Layer 3 redundancy is easy enough to configure using static routes and editing the Administrative Distance (AD)
- Consider the following;

        ISP1                                        ISP2
        
        
        R1                                          R2
              
        
        Dist/CoreSW1                                Dist/CoreSW2
        
        
        AccSW1                                      AccSW2
        
        
        PCs                                         PCs
        
- In this topology PCs connect to Access Layer switches, the Access Layer switches both connected to each Distribution/Core layer switches
- The two Distribution/Core layer switches connect to each other
- Dist/CoreSW1 connects to R1, which then connects to ISP1
- Dist/CoreSW2 connects to R2, which then connects to ISP2
- R1 and R2 connect to each other

- We can configure L3 redundancy on R1 like so;

router>en
router#conf t
router(config)#ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 <ISP1>         <- Default static route up to the ISP
router(config)#ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 <R2 Link> 5    <- Back up default static route over the link to R2 then out to ISP2, should ISP1 go down, notice higher AD
router(config)#ip route <LAN Network> <R2 Link>        <- Static route for the LAN network via R2, should the Connected link via Dist/CoreSW1 go down

### HSRP Configuration

Router 1:

router1>en
router1#conf t
router1(config)#interface fa0/1
router1(config-if)#ip add 10.10.10.2 255.255.255.0
router1(config-if)#no shutdown
router1(config-if)#standby 1 ip 10.10.10.1

Router 2:

router2>en
router2#conf t
router2(config)#interface fa0/1
router2(config-if)#ip add 10.10.10.3 255.255.255.0
router2(config-if)#no shutdown
router2(config-if)#standby 1 ip 10.10.10.1

- NOTE - Identical configurations on each router except the IP address on the physical interface, the last line is the HSRP configuration, everything before is
         just a simple interface IP configuration
         By default the router with the higher IP address will become active whilst the router with the lower IP will becom standby
         
### Verification

router1#show standby  <- View Virtual IP, the State, Virtual MAC address, Active router is local, Standby router is 10.10.10.3
