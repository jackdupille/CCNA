Cloud Computing

- There are traditional deployment models such as "On-Premises" and "Co-lo (Co-Location)"
- On-Prem means all the hardware is on site, you own it, you install the software, rack it up, cable it up and maintain it etc
- Co-Lo means you own the physical hardware and are in charge of installing software and maintaining it, but a Data Centre provider rents out a space for you in
  their data centre, they provide the cooling, rack space, network infrastructure, physical security etc
