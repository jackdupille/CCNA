Standard, Extended and Named ACLs

### Standard vs Extended

- Standard and Extended ACLs are "numbered ACLs"

- If the access list is numbered 1-99 it is a standard ACL
- If it is nunber 100 - 199 it is an extended ACL
- If numbered 1300 - 1999 it is a standard ACL in the expanded range
- If numbered 200 - 2699 it is an extended ACL in the expanded range

1 - 99: Standard ACL
100 - 199: Extended ACL
1300 - 1999: Standard ACL (Expanded range)
2000 - 2699: Extended ACL (Expanded range)

- Standard ACLs reference the source IP address ONLY
- Extended ACLs check based on the protocol, source and destination address and port number

### Standard ACL Example

router(config)#access-list 1 deny 10.10.10.10 0.0.0.0    <- This will block all traffic coming in to the router with a single source IP of 10.10.10.10

router(config)#access-list 1 permit 10.10.10.0 0.0.0.255  <- This will permit all traffic in the 10.10.10.0/24 subnet

- ACLs are checked from top to bottom so traffic from Host 10.10.10.10 will be denied before the ACL reaches the rule to permit all traffic from the same subnet

### Extended ACL Example

router(config)#access-list 100 deny tcp 10.10.10.10 0.0.0.0 gt 49151 10.10.50.10 0.0.0.0 eq 23

  - The above extended ACL is denying TCP traffic only from the host at 10.10.10.10 if it has a source port greater than 49151 and has a destination IP of
    10.10.50.10 and a destination port of 23, which is the Telnet protocol
    
router(config)#access-list 100 permit tcp 10.10.10.0 0.0.0.255 gt 49151 10.10.50.10 0.0.0.0 eq 23

  - The above extended ACL is permitting all TCP traffic from the 10.10.10.0/24 subnet with a source port greater than 49151 and has a destination IP of
    10.10.50.10 and a destination port number of 23, Telnet
    


### Named ACLs

- These allow us to reference an ACL by a name instead of a number
- They can still be of the Standard or Extended variety
- A named ACL command start with the "ip" keyword
- With Named ACLs, we define the type of ACL and give it a name, at which point we enter a sub configuration mode to actually configure the ACEs

### Standard Named ACL Example

    router(config)#ip access-list standard DEMO_ACL
    router(config-std-nacl)#deny 10.10.10.10 0.0.0.0
    router(config-std-nacl)#permit 10.10.10.0 0.0.0.255
