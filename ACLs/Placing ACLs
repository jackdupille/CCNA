Placing ACLs

- Which interface you place an ACL on requires some thought
- It is best practice to place the ACL closest to the source of the traffic so as not to traverse any unnecessary devices
- However this depends on the type of ACL you are using, a standard ACL will match only on the source address NOT the destination address as well, so
  if we place this ACL closest to the source of the traffic we could cut that subnet off from all other parts of the network, not just the particular destination
  subnet
- Therefore it is best to place standard ACLs on the outbound interface of the router that connects to the destination subnet you want to restrict access too
- Once we have decided where we are placing the ACL, we need to add it to the interface

  router#conf t
  router(config)#interface fa0.1
  router(config-if)#ip access-group 1 out   <- ACL 1 in the outound direction on the interface facing the destination subnet we want to restrict access to
