DHCP - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol

### Negotiation Process

1. DHCP Client looks for its DHCP Server by sending out a Broadcast DHCP Discover message, and asking for an IP
2. DHCP Server reponds with a Unicast/Broadcast DHCP Offer message and an available IP address
3. DHCP Client responds with another Broadcast message known as a DHCP Request either accepting or refusing the IP on offer
4. DHCP Server sends the last message, a Unicast/Broadcast DHCP Ack to acknowledge the DHCP Request

There are two main options for configuring a DHCP server
1. Use the Cisco Router to act as the DHCP Server also
2. Use an external DHCP Server
