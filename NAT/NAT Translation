NAT Translations

- To verify out NAT rules we can use the following command

    router#show ip nat translations
    
- There will be quite a bit of output, including headers for INSIDE GLOBAL, INSIDE LOCAL, OUTSIDE GLOBAL and OUTSIDE LOCAL

- Inside Local: The IP address configured on the inside hosts Operating System
                The private IP configured in the host, e.g. 10.0.1.10
                
- Inside Global: The NAT'd address of the inside host as it will be reached via the internet
                 The public IP configured for the NAT rule, e.g 10.0.1.10 > (( 203.0.113.3 )) <- Inside Global
                 
- Outside Local: The IP address of the outside host as it appears to the inside network
                 If the internal server sends traffic to the outside host, what IP would it use? 203.0.113.3 > (( 123.50.3.67 ))  <- Outside Local
                 
- Outside Global: The IP address assigned to the outside host on the outside network by the hosts owner
                  This will be the same as the Outside Local address, the host likely has a Private IP just as the inside host does, but from the Routers point of
                  view, it can't see this IP, it can only see the Outside Local public IP
                  
Outside Local VS Outside Global

- For one way NAT these addresses will be the same from the perspective of our router
- If however we are doing "two way" NAT then the addresses will be different, commonly used if two companies merge
