Static NAT - Network Address Translation

- Permanent one-to-one mapping between a private and public IP address
- Used mainly for servers that must accept incoming connections

### Scenario

- A company has bought the public IP range 23.0.113.0/28
- 203.0.113.1 is used on the ISPs router and is used as the default gateway
- 203.0.113.2 is used on the outside interface of our edge router facing the ISP
- 203.0.113.3 - 203.0.113.14 remain available

- The company has an internal server on private IP 10.0.1.10 which needs to accept incoming connections from the internet
- The server will require a fixed public IP address for this (203.0.113.3)
- We will have to configure a static NAT rule on the Routers outisde interface and inside interface to translate 203.0.113.3 to 10.0.1.10
- The transslation is bidirectional so one static NAT rule will also translate traffic from the server at 10.0.1.10 to 203.0.113.3

### Static NAT Configuration

- First we need to define which is the outisde interface on the Router and which is the inside interface

    router#conf t
    router(config)#interface fa0/0      <- Outside interface
    router(config-if)#ip nat outside
    
    router(config-if)#interface fa1/0   <-Inside interface
    router(config-if)#ip nat inside
    
    router(config-if)#exit
    router(config)#ip nat inside source static 10.0.1.10 203.0.113.3    <- Configure the static NAT rule from 10.0.1.10 > 203.0.113.3
    
 ### Verification
 
    router#show ip nat translation
