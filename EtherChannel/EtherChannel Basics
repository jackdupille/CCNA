EtherChannel Basics

- Used to bond physical interfaces to increase bandwidth
- If we connect interfaces fa0/1 and fa0/2 on switch1 to interface fa0/1 and fa0/2 on switch2, we would for a Layer 2 loop and STP would block one of the ports,
  this would then half our bandwidth and make having two links between the switches pointless
- EtherChannels prevents this by grouping the physical interfaces in to one logical interface, STP sees the EtherChannel as one interface
- The EtherChannel provides load balancing and link redundancy

### NIC Teaming

- This is very similar to EtherChannel, but is configured between a server and a switch
- A traditional PC has only one NIC, but servers often have two, for redundancy
- NIC Teaming allows both the server NICs to be connected to the same switch and bundled together into one logical NIC

### Terminology

- EtherChannels are often also called Port Channels, LAGs (Link Aggregations) or a link bundle
- NIC Teaming is also often called Bonding, NIC Balancing or Link Aggregation


### Load Balancing

- PC1 connects to Server1 anad PC2 connects to Server2
- The traffic flow from PC1 to Server1 will go via one physical link within the EtherChannel and only that link for the duration of the communication
- Similarly with the traffic flow from PC2 to Server2
- The traffic flows are load balanced across all the EtherChannel member links, but the individual packets from each flow will traverse the same physical link
- A round robin load balance of individual packets could cause packets to arrive out of order
- Each flow only receives the maximum bandwidth of the physical link, meaning if we bond 4x 1Gbps interfaces, the whole bandwidth available to the flows is 4Gb
  but each flow individually will only receive 1Gb of bandwidth
