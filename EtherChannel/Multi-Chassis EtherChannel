Multi-Chassis EtherChannel

- EtherChannels are used to prevent STP from blocking redundant ports when two switches connect to each other in order to rpevent Layer 2 loops
- STP will take the same action if we have 3 switches and configure EtherChannels between them. One side of one EtherChannel will be placed in a blocking state
  and the EtherChannel will not be used.
- This is because STP views EtherChannels as individual logical interfaces, so 3 switches connected together will undoubtedly form a loop
- This ultimately makes the use of EtherChannels for additional bandwidth pointless

- If we have an Access Layer switch that connects to two Dist/Core Layer switches via an EtherChannel to both, only one EtherChannel will be used
- Multi-chassis EtherChannels allow the Access Layer switch to use the same EtherChannel to both Dist/Core Layer switches
- This requires the Dist/Core Layer switches to communicate with each other and is only supported on some advanced switches

- STP is still enabled but will not detect any loops
- SUpports full load balancing and redundancy across all interfaces

- Technologies that support this are:
    - StackWise on selected Catalyst switches
    - VSS (Virtual Switching System) on some Catalyst switches
    - VPC (Virtual Port Channel) on Nexus switches
