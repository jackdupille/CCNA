Layer 3 EtherChannel

- The configuration of a Layer 3 EtherChannel is exactly the same as Layer 2 EtherChannel, except we then make the Port-Channel interface a none switchport,
  assign an IP address and bring the interface up with a "no shutdown"
- These are only available on Layer 2 switches, obviously
  
switch1#conf t
switch1(config)#interface range fa0/23 - 24
switch(config-if-range)#no switchport
switch(config-if-range)#channel-group 1 mode active
switch(config-if-range)#interface port-channel 1
switch(config-if)#ip address 192.168.0.1 255.255.255.252
switch(config-if)#no shutdown

### Where do we use them?

- A traditional Campus Design has our end user devices > Access Layer switches > Distribution Layer switches > Core Layer switches > Routers > WAN
- In the traditional design the links between our end user devices, Access Layer switches and Distribution Layer switches are all Layer 2 links
- Spanning Tree is also enabled between the Access Layer and Distribution Layer switches
- Any Default Gateways are also commonly configured on the Distribution Layer switches
- Any link from the Distribution Layer switches to the Core Layer switches and above are Layer 3 links

- It is becoming more and more common to see all links being Layer 3, right down to the Access Layer switches
- This eliminates STP
- The main reason for this change is because the price of Layer 3 switches has reduced significantly
- At this point a routing protocol will also need to be configured on the switches to determine the routing path
- The default gateways for our end hosts also moves down to the Access Layer switches, this is because the host connected to the Access Layer switch will be in one
  subnet, but the switch will connect to the Distribution Layer switch on a different subnet, therefore the hosts would not know how to get to their default gateway
  were it not configured on the Access Layer switch
- It is common to configure Layer 3 EtherChannel between the Access Layer and Distribution Layer switches
