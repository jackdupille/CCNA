DAI (Dynamic ARP Injection)

- Also knows as MITM ARP Spoofing
- Unlike DHCP Snooping, DAI is ALWAYS a malicious attack
- In this case an attacker will be on the same subnet and will send out Gratuitous ARP messages
- Gratuitous ARP messages are ARP messages that are sent NOT in response to ARP Requests
- The attacker will send the Gratuitous ARP messages claiming to be another device on the network, commonly the Router
  - So it will say I am <Router IP> and my MAC is ... and it will provide its actual MAC address, but a false IP. Now the sending PC will send traffic intended for
    the Router to the attackers PC instead, the attacher can then send this traffic to the Router, the return traffic will then be send to the sender via the
    attacker, the attacker is "snooping" on the traffic between the sender and the router
- In order to fix this, we can use DAI. In order to use DAI we need to have enabled DHCP Snooping
    - When DHCP SNooping is enabled on a switch, the switch inspects the DHCP traffic and keeps track of which IP address is assigned to which MAC address
    - If the switch sees traffic saying it is coming from a particular IP, with a different MAC address, the switch drops the traffic
    
### DAI Configuration

- DAI is not enabled on trusted ports, so any device that doesn't get its IP from the DHCP server such as the Router, printers, servers etc. Configure the connected
  switch ports as Trusted Ports

  switch#conf t
  switch(config)#interface fa0/1              <- Interface facing a non-DHCLP client device
  switch(config-if)#ip arp inspection trust   <- Configure as a trusted port

- DAI is only used for DHCP Clients and is configured at the VLAN level

  switch(config)#ip arp inspection vlan <ID>
