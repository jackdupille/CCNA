DHCP Snooping

- If a Rogue DHCP Server is plugged in to the network, it may claim to be the default gateway and DNS server for the network
- PCs on the network are liable to receive a DHCP Offer from this Rogue server instead of the intended legitimate DHCP Server elsewhere on the network
- If they receive a DHCP Offer from the Rogue DHCP Server then they will not get any connectivity
- This cold be a malicious attack, or it could simply be an end user has plugged in a device, such as a Home Router which has a DHCP service running on it
- DHCP Snooping is the fix for this
- We configure the ports on the Access Layer switches that the legitimate DHCP server is connected to as Trusted Ports, this means the inbound switch interfaces
  that will receive packets from the DHCP Server
  
switch1#conf t
switch1(config)#ip dhcp snooping
switch1(config)#ip dhcp snooping vlan 10      <- Enable it at the Access VLAN level
switch1(config)#interface fa0/1               <- Interface facing the DHCP server
switch1(config-if)#ip dhcp snooping trust
