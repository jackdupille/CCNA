802.1X Identity Based Networking

- When 802.1X is enabled, only authentication traffic is allowed on switch ports until the host and user are authenticated
- WHen the user has entered a correct username and password, the switch port transitions to a normal access port in the relevant VLAN
- The switch will connect to an AUthentication server and restrict the users access to the network until authenticated
