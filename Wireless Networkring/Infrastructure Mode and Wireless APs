Infrastructure Mode and Wireless APs

# Wireless Access Points

  - Provide connectivity between wireless stations, and between the wireless stations and the cabled network
  - Wireless operates in half duplex
  - Only one device can communicate at one

# BSS (Basic Service Set)

  - An Access Point centralises access and control over a group of wireless devices
  - The devices and their wireless settings make up a BSS
  - In other words, the AP and the devices connected to it, make up the Basic Service Set
  
# DS (Distribution System)

  - Connects a wireless AP to a wired network
  - Basically an AP connected via ethernet cable to a switch on the wired network
  
# BSSID (Basic Service Set IDentifier)

  - Devices with a BSS are identified by their BSSID which is based on their MAC address
    
# BSA (Basic Service Area)

  - The wireless coverage area of an AP
  - Also known as a wireless cell
  
# SSID (Service Set IDentifier)

  - Unique identifier that names the wireless network, such as "Guest-WiFi"
  
# Multiple SSIDs

  - A single AP can support multiple SSIDs
  - Different SSIDs can have different security settings and be mapped to different VLANs
  
# Beacons

  - APs can broadcast information about the WLANs (including SSIDs and authentication requirements) using beacon frames
  - This feature can be disabled
  
# ESS (Extended Service Set)

  - The same SSID can be supported across multiple APs to increase the coverage area
  - The neighboring APs should use different channels to avoid interferring with each other
  
# Roaming

  - Wireless clients/stations can roam across wireless APs supporting the same WLANs
