Wireless Channels and Radio Frequencies

- WiFi operates in the 2.4GHz > 5.0 GHz range

# 2.4GHZ spectrum

  - Ranges from 2.4 -> 2.4835GHz
  - Divided in to smaller 22MHz ranges of frequencies called "channels"
  - Each AP operates in one channel
  - Some channels overlap and can cause interference with each other
  - Access Points with overlapping services should use non-overlapping channels
  - The channel 1, 6 and 11 are commonly used

# 5GHz spcectrum

  - The channels are 20MHz wide, not 22
  - Less overlap that the 2.4GHz range
  - Neighboring APs should be at least 1 channel apart
  - Channels can be bonded (40, 80 or 160MHz) wide to multiply data rates by 2x, 4x or 8x
 
# Interference

  - The 2.4GHz range is unlicenced meaning many devices can connect to it, increasing the chance of interference

# Comparison

  - 2.4GHz has a greater range and better propagation through objects
  - 2.4GHz is more crowded, leading to higher chance of interference
  - 5GHz 802.11ac has higher throughput than is capable with 2.4GHz
  - Your wireless clients may only be compatible with 2.4GHz
