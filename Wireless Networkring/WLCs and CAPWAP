WLCs and CAPWAP

  - WLCs (Wireless LAN Controllers) can be used a central management popint for APs

# Autonomous vs Lightweight APs

  - Autonomous APs are also called Standalone APs, meaning it is confiured and controlled independently
  - Lightweight APs are APs that are controlled via a WLC
  - The installed software image is the determining factor
  
# Zero Touch Provisioning

  - Lightweight APs support Zero Touch Provisioning
  - They discover their WLC via these three methods:
    1. DHCP: Option 43 gives the IP address of the WLC
    2. DNS: "cisco-capwap-controller" resolves the IP address of the WLC
    3. Local subnet broadcast
    
  - Once the AP has located the WLC, it will connect to it and download its configuration
  - This includes what WLANs it should support and their settings
  - The WLC also monitors the wireless quality and controls the channels and power of the AP
  - The WLC can also deteect rogue APs
  
# Roaming

  - APs can supprt roaming so devices will connect to additional APs as they move around the office space
  - If authentication is handled by each AP seperately, then there will be a break in service as your device re-authenticates with the nearest AP
  - Using a WLC, authentication can be moved to the WLC and make roaming seamless
  
# CAPWAP (Control And Provisioning of Wireless Access Points)

  - Standardised protocl that enables WLCs to manage a collection of APs
  - Communications are encrypted inside a DTLS CAPWAP tunnel
  - Uses UDP ports 5246 and 5247
  
# Split MAC

  - Works is moved from the APs to the WLC, hence the name Lightweight APs
  - Real-time traffic is still handled by the AP in order to provide suitable performance, everything else is handled by the WLC
  - This is known as "Split MAC"
  - AP Operations:
      1.Client handshake wheen connecting
      2. Beacons
      3. Performance monitoring
      4. Encryption and Decryption
      5. Clients in power save
  - WLC Operations:
      1. Autnentication
      2. Roaming Control
      3. 802.11 to 802.3 communications
      4. Radio Frequency management
      5. Security management
      6. QoS management
      - If a WLC is being used, all traffic from a wireless client/station will flow through the WLC, which will then forward it on to the destination
      - Management traffic between the AP anWLC will also pass through the CAPWAP tunnel
      - An Etherchannel (LAG) is often used for the connection between the WLC and the network switch
      
# FlexConnect

  - If their is a Main office with the WLC and a remote branch office with APs, if two wireless clients at the branch offce want to communicate,
    traffic would have to go over the CAPWAP tunnel on the WAN link to the WLC and back, which is not desirable
  - FlexConnect mitigates this and forwards traffic locally, useful if the breanch office does not have a WLC
